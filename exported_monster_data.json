In the \"Song of Dobharcu,\" the writer describes the outcome of the war: the great Hunter's Ray known as the Stormlord stirred huge waves in its death throes, causing what is now known by the people as the \"first diluvian period\"...\nOf course, all of this is nothing more than the romantic imaginations of people who are unwilling to accept the bland realities of the world.

Although this contradicts another theory regarding the origin of Xuanwen Beasts, the few records of the suanni often show them attended by a large number of Xuanwen Beasts.\nThese days, the well-known Wushou Dance in Chenyu Vale came from the movements of the suanni. But since only a handful of people have actually seen such creatures, most can only imagine what they look like.

They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates.

As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\nMade of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in \"group shifts\" â€” when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift. In the eyes of ordinary people, these \"Iron Fishes\" seem to be able to reproduce themselves in a never-ending stream. Catching a few of them from time to time is certainly no cause for a guilty conscience.",

They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination.

Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. \nTo protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.\nHowever, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.",

At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the \"Platinum Collection\" batch are no exception â€” they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive \"fishes\" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, \"the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question.\" Nowadays, surviving \"Platinum Collection\" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches.

It wears a luxurious coat of brilliant green feathers, seemingly with a delicate, silky ruff, while its tail feathers are as gorgeous as budding flowers.\nPerhaps on account of its all-too-luxuriant feathers, akin to a field of flammable flowers, this bird is still afraid of fire, despite living in Natlan's heat. In addition, while other birds may appear fluffy but are actually quite sturdy, what the Thick-Feathered Ruffed Pheasant has beneath its thick feathers is... a very thick, round layer of fat. Thus, it strains itself even by flying normally, and has been called a \"Potted plant with wings that can't fly\" by the Scions of the Canopy...",

A legend holds that once, several adventurers who visited Natlan attempted to conduct in-depth research on Flying Squirrels, but the little guys often let their pride run loose while they were riding the wind. It was thus quite difficult to keep up with them, let alone observe their movements in any great detail. Since then, the title of \"Flying Squirrel Level\" has been circulated via the Adventurers' Guild's Natlan branch, which is used to describe those supreme masters who have perfected the art of using wind gliders to the point that they \"glide as agilely as a Flying Squirrel.\"",

Tourists consider them to be the paragon of animal friends.\nCapybaras like to zone out while having a soak in the water, or sun themselves on the shore, and it's quite common for them to barely move for most of the day, as though not a single thing in the world could possibly perturb their calm demeanor and make them anxious. Despite their fluffy appearance, their hairs are actually quite hard and tough. If you pet them in the same direction as their coat of hair, it feels relatively smooth, but should you pet them in the opposite direction, you may end up with a scratched hand. Perhaps that is the reason even famished predators do not regard these completely harmless and quite defenseless little friends as prey...",

Actually, there really is a balloon-like swim bladder in there.\nWhile the Phony Phlogiston Unihornfish can provide graffiti enthusiasts with precious paints, they can only live in liquid phlogiston environments. Thus, the Graffiti Alliance began to explore raising this kind of fish in ordinary aqueous environments. To accomplish this, the previous Graffiti Alliance's leader's previous predecessor began to work with the Natlan Fishing Association, expending an enormous sum to import clockwork fish from Fontaine, using \"Maintenance Mek\" tech to build an ecological simulation mek with onboard data collection capabilities and conduct extensive observations and research. Alas, the results were most disappointing: the horn-like crystal structures on Unihornfish heads ceased to shine with flame-like light after the fish left their liquid phlogiston environment, and so, the plan ended in failure.\nFortunately, due to the way their dorsal fin extends above the water while they swim, these mek Unihornfish look kind of like sharks from a distance. Thanks to this, the People of the Springs ended up buying an appropriate quantity of these \"Pseudoshark Unihornfish\" from the Graffiti Alliance and Natlan Fishing Association.
