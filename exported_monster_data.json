But eventually, it became simply too gargantuan. Before the first diluvian period, a massive Armored Crab once attacked a ship, and was finally forced back into the depths by Basil Elton, who had not yet been reinstated as a naval commander.\nImagine this world: All of humanity has been purged from Teyvat, and the ever-growing Emperor of Fire and Iron eventually wears the Palais Mermonia upon its body like a luxurious coat of white stone. Of course, in such a world, there naturally would be no one to call it, half-jokingly and half in awe, the \"Emperor of Fire and Iron.\"",

In the \"Song of Dobharcu,\" the writer describes the outcome of the war: the great Hunter's Ray known as the Stormlord stirred huge waves in its death throes, causing what is now known by the people as the \"first diluvian period\"...\nOf course, all of this is nothing more than the romantic imaginations of people who are unwilling to accept the bland realities of the world.

Although this contradicts another theory regarding the origin of Xuanwen Beasts, the few records of the suanni often show them attended by a large number of Xuanwen Beasts.\nThese days, the well-known Wushou Dance in Chenyu Vale came from the movements of the suanni. But since only a handful of people have actually seen such creatures, most can only imagine what they look like. After thousands of years of changes and different artistic interpretations, the Wushou Dance costume head has developed into its current style.",

In the most fantastical stories or outrageous lies, the stars found in the depths of the cosmos might be teeming with life, much like Teyvat, and the universe itself is akin to an ocean. Realistically speaking, however, if a profound universe full of life exists, why hasn't any of that life made contact with Teyvat?\nMaybe the universe has been constantly trying to infiltrate Teyvat, or maybe a higher power created borders to protect this world.",
